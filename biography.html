							<p>Allison Li is a part of the Aragon High School class of 2021. An avid learner, she began programming in her freshman year of high school and soon found a new hobby to carry with her in the next few years. Currently, she is the vice-president of the Aragon Programming Club and hopes to change the common stereotyping that surrounds the subject. This project is a part of the final for her AP Computer Science class which she took in her junior year. When she is not coding, she can be found picking up new musical instruments. So far, she has picked up 5 different instruments (although she is still an extreme novice in some). </p>
